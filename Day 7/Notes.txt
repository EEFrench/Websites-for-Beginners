Notes on GitHub & GitBash

commands you will use most :

git status
git add -A
git commit -m "enter description here of what youâ€™ve done"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin [repository]
after your initial push you only need to type:
git push

When making a commit statement be short and 
concise. Push several times with a short
commit comment rather than make a long comment about a lot of changes.

All your pushes are stored in the Repository, 
so you can go back to them if things get 
really broken.
So commit and push often!

You can push from the VSCode terminal as well. 
from the menu choose "Terminal" -> 
"New Terminal"
In the terminal below near the word "powershell"
is a "+" and a down arrow. Click the down arrow 
and choose "Git Bash"
It works just like the regular GitBash.
